# Ticketmaster Web App

This app can be used to store data about different events on Ticketmaster and display that data with a click of a button!

Add events to the navigation bar on the left by typing in the name of the event and pressing the "Add Event" button.

The navigation bar will display all the events you have added in order by name and date. Click the name of the event whose details you want to see.

No longer interested in an event? Simply click the "Delete Event" button underneath the event name in the navigation bar to remove it.
